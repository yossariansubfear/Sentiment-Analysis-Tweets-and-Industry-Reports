# Sentiment-Analysis-Document-Level-and-Sentence-Level

The project tries to analyse sentiments at the following two levels
1. Document Level
2. Sentence Level

For document level, we take the industry outlook report of two independent companies in the airline sector in India. We have taken the reports published by ICRA and CMIE in the third quarter of 2018.

The analysis was done in R and the code for the same is available in the same folder. The results of the analysis are given below:
The ICRA report starts with a strong positive note, discusses some of the issues and then finishes in a slightly positive note. The overall sentiment of the ICRA report is 42.65.

On the other hand, even though the CMIE report starts with a strong positive sentiment similar to ICRA report it slowly turns negative and closes with a moderately weak sentiment. Because of this, the overall sentiment of the CMIE report is a meagre 9.1 as against the 42.65 of ICRA.
